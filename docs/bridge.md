# Bridge (Windows-hosted ChatGPT session → Linux clients)

Oracle’s bridge workflow lets you keep an authenticated ChatGPT session on a Windows machine while running Oracle (CLI + `oracle-mcp`) from Linux boxes (often over SSH), without exporting browser cookies off Windows.

## Concepts

- **Host (Windows)**: runs `oracle bridge host` and holds the signed-in ChatGPT session.
- **Client (Linux)**: stores the host connection once and routes browser runs (and MCP browser runs) through the host.

The host sanitizes incoming attachment filenames for staging. If names collide after sanitization (or differ only by case), later uploads receive a unique numeric suffix before the extension, while their original display paths and payload order are retained. This applies to both primary uploads and prompt-size fallback uploads. Non-colliding filenames are unchanged; supplied names such as `a_b-2.txt` are reserved before suffix allocation.

## Generated artifact transfer

Bridge runs now keep the Windows browser host and Linux client separated while still returning ChatGPT-generated files, such as ZIP, CSV, PDF, wheels, and source distributions, to a cloud-readable path. The host advertises artifact-transfer support from the token-protected `GET /health` response. The Linux client uses that capability signal in `oracle bridge client --test` and `oracle bridge doctor`; older hosts remain usable for text responses, but generated files require manual copy from the Windows browser until both sides are upgraded.

The transfer protocol is pull-based and keeps secrets local to the host:

1. The browser host saves the ChatGPT file to its local session artifacts directory as before.
2. The host emits only a redacted artifact descriptor over the existing NDJSON run stream: artifact id, safe filename, MIME type, byte size, SHA-256, validation status, and coarse source kind. It does not expose cookies, bearer tokens, signed ChatGPT download URLs, or Windows filesystem paths.
3. The Linux client fetches `GET /runs/<runId>/artifacts/<artifactId>` with the same bridge bearer token, writes to `~/.oracle/sessions/<sessionId>/artifacts/`, verifies size and SHA-256, validates ZIP structure when applicable, and only then publishes the final path in session metadata.
4. If transfer fails, Oracle keeps the text response and records a warning with manual fallback instructions. Open the ChatGPT browser on the Windows host, use the visible download button/link in the current assistant response, and copy the file to a cloud-readable path yourself.

Operational notes:

- Run the same patched Oracle version on both Windows host and Linux client before relying on automatic file transfer. Mixed versions remain backward compatible for text-only runs.
- `oracle bridge doctor` reports `Artifact transfer: bridge v1` when the host supports the protocol, including the advertised maximum artifact size.
- The default bridge transfer size limit is 512 MiB. Larger files stay on the browser host and require manual copy.
- Session inspection prints artifact path, size, SHA-256 prefix, validation status, and transfer status so agents can verify whether the returned path is local to the Linux client.

## 1) Windows: start the host service (recommended)

Run this on the Windows machine that’s signed into ChatGPT:

```powershell
oracle bridge host --token auto --ssh user@your-linux-host
```

What it does:

- Starts a local `oracle serve` instance bound to `127.0.0.1:9473` by default.
- Generates an access token (stored to disk; not printed unless you ask).
- Starts an SSH reverse tunnel so the Linux host can reach the Windows service at `127.0.0.1:9473`.
- Writes a connection artifact to `~/.oracle/bridge-connection.json` (contains host + token).

Useful flags:

- Bind a different local port: `--bind 127.0.0.1:9474`
- Use a specific token: `--token <value>`
- Print the connection string (includes token): `--print`
- Print only the token: `--print-token`
- SSH port/custom args: `--ssh-extra-args "-p 2222"`
- Background mode (writes pid/log files under `~/.oracle`): `--background`

## 2) Linux: configure the client once

Copy the connection artifact from Windows to Linux (example from Windows → Linux):

```powershell
scp "$env:USERPROFILE\.oracle\bridge-connection.json" user@your-linux-host:~/bridge-connection.json
```

Then on the Linux host:

```bash
oracle bridge client --connect ~/bridge-connection.json --write-config --test
```

This writes:

- `~/.oracle/config.json` → `browser.remoteHost` and `browser.remoteToken`

Now browser runs automatically route through the host:

```bash
oracle --engine browser -p "hello" --file README.md
```

## 2b) Linux desktop: local manual-login (no bridge)

If you’re physically on a Linux desktop and just want Oracle to reuse a local signed-in Chrome profile (no Windows bridge):

1. Run a browser session once and sign in when Chrome opens:

```bash
ORACLE_HOME_DIR=~/.oracle-local \
ORACLE_BROWSER_PROFILE_DIR=~/.oracle-local/browser-profile \
oracle --engine browser --browser-manual-login --browser-keep-browser -p "hello"
```

2. After you’re signed in, reuse the same env vars for future runs (no more login prompts).

Optional: use the helper wrapper `scripts/oracle-local-browser.sh` to avoid repeating flags/env vars:

```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/oracle-local-browser.sh
./scripts/oracle-local-browser.sh -p "hello" --file README.md
```

## 3) Codex CLI (MCP) integration

On the Linux machine where Codex runs:

```bash
oracle bridge codex-config
```

Paste the printed snippet into `~/.codex/config.toml`.

## 3b) Claude Code (MCP) integration

On the Linux machine where Claude Code runs:

```bash
oracle bridge claude-config > .mcp.json
```

Then start Claude Code with that config (or register it via `claude mcp add` depending on your setup).

Notes:

- The snippet includes `ORACLE_ENGINE="browser"` so MCP consult calls use browser mode even if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set.
- By default the snippets leave `ORACLE_REMOTE_TOKEN` as `<YOUR_TOKEN>` to avoid printing secrets; rerun with `--print-token` if you explicitly want it included.

### macOS local browser: Let Them Fight

If Claude Code and the signed-in Chrome profile are on the same Mac, skip the remote bridge and generate a local config:

```bash
oracle bridge claude-config --local-browser > .mcp.json
```

This points Claude Code at `oracle-mcp`, sets `ORACLE_ENGINE="browser"`, and reuses the shared manual-login profile at `~/.oracle/browser-profile`. From Claude Code, call `consult` with `preset:"chatgpt-pro-heavy"` for the “Let Them Fight” workflow: Claude asks Oracle, Oracle asks ChatGPT Pro Extended in browser mode, and the answer comes back through MCP. Use `dryRun:true` first when you only want to validate the resolved request.

For long Pro runs, keep the Oracle session id visible in the agent transcript and inspect `oracle status` / `oracle session <id>` before retrying. Browser consults may wait on ChatGPT for several minutes; the dry-run/browser control plan is the operator-facing signal for whether Oracle will attach to an existing browser, use remote Chrome, or launch a visible window.

Override local paths when needed:

```bash
oracle bridge claude-config \
  --local-browser \
  --oracle-home-dir ~/.oracle \
  --browser-profile-dir ~/.oracle/browser-profile > .mcp.json
```

## 4) Troubleshooting

Run:

```bash
oracle bridge doctor
```

It checks:

- Whether a remote host/token is configured
- TCP reachability to the remote host
- Remote auth via `GET /health` (token-protected)
- If no remote is configured, it probes local Chrome + cookie DB detection and suggests `--browser-chrome-path` / `--browser-cookie-path`

## Security notes

- Tokens are not printed by default.
- The connection artifact and config file contain secrets; keep them private (Oracle writes them with restrictive permissions on Unix).
- Bridge does **not** extract/decrypt cookies from arbitrary profiles; the Windows machine keeps the authenticated session locally.
